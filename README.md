# Nekoration

#### A Decoration Mod for Minecraft

### Introduction
Nekoration is a mod for Minecraft(1.16.5 and newer) which adds lots of decorational stuff to the game, allowing players to have a wider choice when building & creating.

### About Its Name
The name 'Nekoration' is a compound of 'cat' in Japanese(ねこ, neko) and 'decoration', suggesting that the mod is both ornamental and cats-friendly...  ^._.^= ∫

### Features
#### Dyeing
Most of Nekoration's blocks are dyeable using vanilla dyes, so that you can turn almost everything in this mod to your favorite shade!

#### Auto-Connecting Model (without Texture-connecting mods)
Many blocks in Nekoration supports model auto connecting, to name a few, Half-Timber Pillars and Lamp Posts. When being placed by players, they'll automatically adapt to connect to adjacent blocks.

#### Painting
Painting is a feature under development with which you can draw your OWN paintings! You can easily pick colors with a palette item, and enjoy creating your art work on a custom painting!

#### Wallpaper
With Nekoration, you can turn any Banner into Wallpaper with exactly the same pattern, just the way you make Shields from Banners. Then you can place it on any wall surface(several pieces of wallpaper can fit into a 1x1x1 space, so don't worry about room corners).

#### Neko Brochure
Once you install the mod with Patchouli, you'll find a red brochure in 'Neko Tools' tab, which introduces all aspects of Nekoration, like recipes and mechanics. The book is still being written, and will be of more use as the mod updates.
