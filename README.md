#### A Decoration Mod for Minecraft

### Introduction

### About Its Name
The name 'Nekoration' is a compound of 'cat' in Japanese(ねこ, neko) and 'decoration', being made up for fun, the name doesn't really stand for anything...

### Features
#### Dyeing
Most of Nekoration's blocks are dyeable using vanilla dyes, so that you can turn almost everything in this mod to your favorite shade!

#### Auto-Connecting Model (without Texture-connecting mods)
